[theme] The concept of "nearby in space, but close in time" was explored through the choice of setting, which is situated right here at UCSC but in a distant future. In this intriguing timeframe, the player must contend with the relentless pursuit of mutated slugs. <br>

[selectable requirements] <br>
Data-driven experience progression: We read from a json file to configure object speeds <br>
Complete closed captioning: Sound effects for everything but button clicks as the scene immediately changes anyways on button clicks <br>
Procedural graphics: We use a shader on the title screen <br>
